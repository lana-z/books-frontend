## Team Agreements

#### Logistical
- Available all hours between 8:30am and 10:00pm 
- We will use to Slack to communicate
- We'll take breaks when we need a break and we'll be quick to communicate when that is.
- If we start to fall behind, we will ask for help from classmates, TAs or John. 

#### Cooperative
Strengths: Kyle - good understanding of the backend and how all pieces communicate. Lana - design and postive attitude.
- We'll utilize these strengths in the development of our application by communicating and relying on each other. 
- Working on developing greater strengths: Kyle - working with Mongo. Lana - fullstack, practice applying all aspects. 
- So that both of us understand the code, we plan to talk through the code as we work and swap driver-navigator daily. 
#### Conflict Resolution
- If we have any issues like one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing, or taking over the project or anything else, we will voice the concern to each other, then ask for help from John if it's a problem.
